An unofficial app for the Top Gun Robotics Team (FRC 1294)

## About

[Top Gun Robotics (FRC 1294)](http://www.team1294.org/) participates in the FIRST Robotics Competiton... `to be continued`

This app is a hub app that launches off into various things, such as the website, Facebook, and acts as a countdown to events and a client to access our calendar (to be added).

## Download

At this point much of the app is in an unfinished state. If you'd really like to get a build, I'll be adding an `.apk` you can sideload (instructions to be added), and maybe even add it to the Play Store. However, if you really need it **now**:

1. Install Android Studio
2. Install (at least) API Level 21 and some of the build tools, as well as probably the USB Driver.
  - I have no idea exactly what you'll need, but you'll probably need some of the top packages, API level 21 as that's what I'm curently building against, and maybe some of the packages in the `Extras` bundle at the bottom of the SDK Manager.
3. Install
 
  a. Either click the run button in Android Studio to push a _"debug"_ build of the app, or...

  b. build your own APK under the build menu with your own keystore.
4. Make sure to take a look at **Things to Note** below.

_(I'll be adding a better guide at a later date.)_

## Things to Note

Make sure to generate your own Calendar API key if you make your own APK. Instructions are provided on the Google Developers website (link to be added later).
